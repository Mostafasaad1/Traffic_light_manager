# Traffic Light Manager
This project is a Traffic Light Manager implemented using C/C++ programming language, AVR Studio IDE, and simulation tools like Proteus and Simulide. The purpose of this README file is to provide an overview of the project and highlight its key features and components.

## Overview
The Traffic Light Manager is a software application that controls the operation of a traffic light system. It was developed from scratch and designed to interact with specific hardware peripherals or devices. The project includes a hardware layer, application layer, and pin layer, each responsible for different aspects of the system's functionality.

## Key Features
Driver Development: Each driver was developed from scratch to interact with specific hardware peripherals or devices required for the traffic light system.

### Hardware Layer: 
The hardware layer was implemented from scratch and includes the ATmega32 microcontroller and other necessary electronic components.

### Application Layer:
The application layer was developed from scratch and incorporates the main logic and functionality of the traffic light system.

### Pin Layer: 
The pin layer was created from scratch to control the microcontrollerâ€™s I/O pins, enabling communication with connected hardware components.

### AVR Studio IDE: 
AVR Studio, an integrated development environment (IDE), was utilized for programming the ATmega32 microcontroller.

### Simulation and Testing: 
Proteus and Simulide were used as simulation tools to test and ensure the functionality of the project before deployment on physical hardware.
